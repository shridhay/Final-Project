# shutter-ros

ROS codebase for the robot [Shutter](https://shutter.interactive-machines.com).

See the code `documentation` at [https://shutter-ros.readthedocs.io](https://shutter-ros.readthedocs.io). Quick installation instructions are provided in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Shutter Codebase

The robot's codebase includes the following packages:

- **shutter_bringup:** roslaunch scripts for starting the robot
- **shutter_description:** 3D models of the robot for simulation and visualization


## Meta-documentation

Documentation for this repository is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/shutter-ros/).
Specifically, the documentation is generated by converting the package readmes into `.rst` markup with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org).
The readmes are parsed as [Markedly Structured Text](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io), which extends Markdown syntax with extra styling, e.g. for images.

For the most part, the readmes can be composed in conventional Markdown syntax.
Images are the primary elements that require extra steps:

1. Save images to the `documentation/source/images` directory.
2. In the readme markdown, source the images from the directory `shutter-ros/images`, which is symlinked to the above directory.
3. Specify [supported image attributes](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/optional.html#inline-attributes) within curly braces, `{attribute=value}`.

An example image element:

```
![Shutter MoveIt and ROS Control components](../images/shutter_moveit_ros_control.png){w=700x align=center}
```

To build the documentation locally, clone this repository and setup a Python virtual environment:

```bash
$ cd shutter-ros/documentation
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

// build the documentation
(venv) $ sphinx-build -b html source build
```

Then, assuming there are no build errors, serve the generated HTML:

```bash
$ cd shutter-ros/documentation/build
$ python3 -m http.server
```

The generated documentation can be viewed by opening a web browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
